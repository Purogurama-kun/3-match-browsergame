# Explosive Candy Story Plan

This plan describes the cutscenes that introduce Mira, her sparkling cleanup magic, and the festival beats that guide players through the match-3 acts. Each entry names the required large background asset and gives Mira a short line explaining what she is doing during the transition.

## Act 1 – Setup
**Background:** `assets/images/vendor-plaza.png` (vendor plaza)  
**Cutscene:** Mira is ringing the bell of her candy cart while juggling orders and festival inspectors circle the square. Neighbors glance over with hopeful eyes as Mira concentrates on the delicate gestures that trigger her tiny detonations.  
**Mira (voice-over):** “I can send a sparkle right through the bad pieces—no mess, just clean air and fresh treats.”  
She promises the inspectors she will keep everything spotless and lets the first puff of candy light drift into the sky as the opening sequence ends.

## Act 2 – Progression
### Vendor Plaza Transition
**Background:** `assets/images/vendor-plaza.png`  
**Cutscene:** Mira steps through a crowded aisle where someone left a pile of hard candies that refuse to match. She whispers a gentle countdown, and the controlled burst fizzles them away while her fresh sweets settle back into their slots.  
**Mira:** “One precise blast, and the stubborn bits are gone—everyone can keep their rhythm.”

### Ribbon Alley Transition
**Background:** `assets/images/ribbon-alley.png`  
**Cutscene:** A ribbon artisan calls out for help, frightened her woven glow will tangle the match grid. Mira steadies herself, sending a soft shower of sparkles that clears the sticky corruption and leaves the ribbons still shimmering.  
**Mira:** “You keep painting those ribbons. I’ll keep the grid calm.”

### Lantern Bridge Transition
**Background:** `assets/images/lantern-bridge.png`  
**Cutscene:** Lanterns sway above syrupy drips on the bridge. Mira guides her ability over the bridge, letting a trail of tiny pops sweep away the syrup without tearing down the lantern glow. A lantern keeper nods in thanks as she passes.  
**Mira:** “Syrup off the path, lanterns still glowing—this bridge stays festival-ready.”

## Act 3 – Finale
**Background:** `assets/images/festival.png` (main festival square)  
**Cutscene:** Mira arrives at the stage to find the final spill of corrupted candy looming over the crowd’s entrance. She kneels, focusing on the choreography of her detonations. Each successful combo lights a trail of edible sparks that float above the stage and reassure the arriving townsfolk.  
**Mira:** “Just one more choreographed burst; the stage will be perfect for the show.”

## Final Cutscene – Fireworks
**Background:** `assets/images/festival.png` (festival sky)  
**Cutscene:** With the crowd cheering, Mira triggers a triumphant cascade of candy fireworks where every blast leaves a shimmering bloom that drifts upward. Edible sparks spiral into the night, symbolizing the order she restored. Festival organizers offer her a booth as the fireworks fade into celebration.  
**Mira:** “Clean streets, happy neighbors, and candy stars—this is how I celebrate the festival.”
