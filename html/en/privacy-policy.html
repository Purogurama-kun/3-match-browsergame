                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This privacy statement applies to the Explosive Candy match-3 browser game hosted at this domain. It explains which information is collected or generated, why the data is processed, and what rights you have.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="legal__section">
                <h2>Data we collect</h2>
                <p>If you sign in with Google, we receive your Google identifier (sub), display name, email address (if provided), and the locale you have set in your account. We also collect gameplay progress, best scores per mode, purchased powerups, and sugar coin balance in our SQLite backend as part of your authenticated profile.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="legal__section">
                <h2>Local storage</h2>
                <p>Independent from authentication, we persist progress in your browser’s localStorage under the keys <code>match3-progress</code> and <code>match3-highest-level</code>. This allows you to resume matches and keep tactical powerups even without signing in. Clearing your progress removes these entries.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="legal__section">
                <h2>Purpose of processing</h2>
                <p>We process progress data to unlock higher levels, display the leaderboard, and synchronize scores/powerups across devices when logged in. Personal data is necessary to link progress to an account and to display your name in the leaderboard.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="legal__section">
                <h2>Retention and deletion</h2>
                <p>Server-side progress stays linked to your Google ID until you explicitly delete it. Local progress persists until the browser data is cleared or you choose to delete progress manually. You can request deletion via the options screen.</p>

                <h2>Third-party services</h2>
                <p>Google Identity Services are used solely to authenticate players; no additional Google APIs are contacted. No other third-party tracking is embedded in the game.</p>

                <h2>Your rights</h2>
                <p>You may request access, correction, portability, or deletion of your data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:fehrenworks@gmail.com">fehrenworks@gmail.com</a>. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.</p>
